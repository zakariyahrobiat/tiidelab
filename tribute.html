       <h1> <b>TRIBUTE TO NELSON MANDELA</b></h1><hr><br>
        <img src="nelson-mandela.jpg">
        <p>A giant has passed.  Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela born July 18, 1918 <br>in Mvezo, South Africa, died on December 5, 2013 in Johannesburg.   
        <p>As US President Barack Obama noted in his tribute to Mandela on <br>December 5th, “He no longer belongs to us, he belongs to the ages.”  <br>As true as that statement is, it is also worrisome. The Ages has a way of <br>erasing complexity, overlooking inconguities, evading parodoxes, and of <br>reducing everything in its wake to easily digestible caricatures amenable <br>to soundbite summaries.  Mandela had nearly reached that iconic status <br>during the final days of his life, and this process will surely accelerate<br> with his passing.  Unfortunately, many of life’s most profound lessons <br>are not simple truths, but rather instead lurk about in the interstitial <br>regions between varying shades of gray.  Thus, while it is still fresh in<br> my mind, let me reflect on three episodes that I think would better<br> anchor the Mandela legend, more so than the emerging wooden image of a <br>man who singlehandly pushed South Africa toward reconcilliation rather <br>than revenge.</p>
        <p><ol><li>First, it is indeed clear that by the time Mandela emerged from <br>prison in 1990 he had become the very embodiment of peace.  <br>Everything about him, his persona, his pace, his policies all radiated <br>peace.  However Mandela’s enduring power and legitimacy among<br> constituents at the grassroots extended from the stance he had taken three <br>decades earlier- he was willing to die for a free South Africa.  Having lost faith<br> that passive and non-violent resistance would ever bear fruit, Mandela <br>set up the armed wing of the African National Congress, Umkhonto we Sizwe <br>(Spear of the Nation).  He was a freedom fighter, he learned to make bombs,<br> and supported the attack on the physical infrastructure that underpinned <br>the power of the Apartheid government.   Even when captured and put on trial,<br> he did not beg for leniency or forbearance.  Instead he appeared for<br> sentencing in full African regalia, denounced the government as the <br>aggressors, acknowledged that he was at war, and ready to serve his time<br> as a prisoner of war and not as a criminal.</li>
        <span><ul><li>Those images of Mandela as warrior, were the last live images many <br>would see of him until his release 27 years later.  Words of his <br>willingness to die for his ideals resonated and reverberated throughout <br>cities and townships, and inspired sucessive waves of men, women and <br>children to continue the struggle, despite the blood and the rising body count.<br>  To reduce Mandela to the kindly old man ever urging peace, ever ready to <br>forgive all, is to deny the fact that certain historical moments, certain<br> historical conditions will only change with struggle.</li></ul></span>
        <li>Secondly, the Apartheid government did not release Mandela because <br>of pangs of consciousness, a sudden awareness that Apartheid was evil, or<br> even an epiphany that blood was bad for business.  Nor should we give all<br> the credit to anti-apartheid movements in the US, Europe and elsewhere,<br> as extremely valuable as they were. I lived in Africa and indeed in two<br> frontline states during the most intense years of the global anti-apartheid<br> movements, and it is clear to me that African contributions were <br>immeasureable.  Some countries struggled against South Africa despite <br>suffering economic strangulation, the blockade of transportation, the <br>cut-off of energy flows, and even kidnappings and military assaults on<br> their territory by South African forces.  There is plenty of credit to go<br> around</li>
    <span><ul><li>Yet not nearly enough credit is heaped on the South African people <br>themselves.  They are the true heroes, and the true liberators of Mandela.<br>  It was they who sacrificed careers, schooling, life and limb to “make the <br>townships ungovernable.”   Millions of nameless, faceless individuals, many<br> who never saw or heard Nelson Mandela directly, many in fact born after <br>he was incarcerated yet were inspired by the image and ideals of Mandela.<br> The Ages is quick to forget The Masses.  Rarely are statues erected to The <br>Masses. It is far easier to endlessly eulogize an icon than it is to tease<br> out the causality and complex conditions under which the long oppressed<br> rise up against their oppressors.</li></ul></span>
    <li>Thirdly, perhaps Mandela’s greatest gift to his nation was the act of <br>stepping down after one term as president.  That act solidifies, in my mind<br> at least, that Mandela’s true genius lay in his capacity to read the moment,<br> to identify the constellation of political, economic and cultural factors<br> at play at a given historical point, and to decide accordingly the role he<br> should play.  It is the arc of Mandela’s life that history will be richer <br>for remembering.  He knew when to be a warrior, when to be a peacemaker, <br>and when to step away.  Life is not about selecting and steadfastly <br>maintaining positions that all too quickly calcify with time.  It is about<br> recognizing and adjusting to temporal shifts in the texture of day-to-day <br>life.  </li>
<span><ul><li>Despite the name, The Ages is actually not very good at dealing with time.<br>  It hates to revisit, reinterpret and reanalyze its subjects.  It prefers <br>timeless, cookie cutter images that can be brought out for annual <br>celebrations, and then neatly stored away until the following year.  Hence,<br> it is incumbent upon all of us who genuinely loved and were inspired by <br>Madiba to rescue him from The Ages, to keep the whole of the man alive,<br> to keep him embedded in real history and not to allow a decontextualized <br>caricature to emerge and overshadow the real man.  Even in his final years<br> Mandela was changing, re-reading the moment, teaching us new lessons and<br> realizing the need to call attention to issues other than racism.  <br>Combating obscene levels of global inequality became his final clarion call.</li></span></ol></p>
    <p>Massive poverty and obscene inequality are such terrible scourges of our <br>times … that they have to rank alongside slavery and apartheid as social<br> evils. </p>
    <p>Millions of people in the world’s poorest countries remain imprisoned,<br> enslaved, and in chains.  They are trapped in the prison of poverty. It <br>is time to set them free.</p>
    <p>— Nelson Mandela, Tafalger Square, London, February 3, 2005</p>
    <p>Rest well Madiba, assured that A Luta Continua! </p>
